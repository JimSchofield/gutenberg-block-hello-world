# Gutenberg Block Hello World

This is a bare-bones build process using webpack to compile a Gutenberg Block outlined in [this article](http://jschof.com/gutenberg-blocks/gutenberg-blocks-made-easy/)

To use, clone into the plugins folder of your WordPress instance and activate in the plugins menu.  You must have Project Gutenberg installed as well for this to function.
